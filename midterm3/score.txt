Function 1
3/5
The “*” needs to be escaped to “\\*”

Function 2
2/5
Line 29 should be return(0) rather than return 0.
gregexpr does not work quite the way envisaged by 
this response. You may consider something along 
the lines of return(length(ind.digit)) although
this makes no allowance for strings with no 
numbers.

Function 3
3/5
Consider
him <- (gsub('him','them',chvec))
he <- (gsub('he','they’,him))
his <-(gsub('his','their’,he))
return(his)

Your function also replaces this -> ttheir.


Function 4
1/5
strap and splitter are not defined in R or in your 
function.
