	The general observation regarding density was, that the higher the density setting was, the more prone to blockage
the traffic was. Generally, at p values lower than 0.25 there was minimal blocking and for p-values between 0.25-0.55
there was some generally free flowing traffic with some blocking. The blocking seemed to resolve itself in part as
the number of iterations increased. At densities at or close to 1, the traffic blocked almost immediately.
	The traffic behavior was typically  noticeable after 2000-2500 time steps (or iterations). Genenrally, with
more time steps the flow of traffic was better realized. Also, there was free flow if all cars moved for
the lcm(grid) time steps. In other words, for a 2*3 grid, the grid state after the 6th state is equivalent to the 
original grid state. Thus, to determine a gridlock, there had to be one simlation step in which no cars moved.
	The shape and size of the grid did affect the traffic behavior. Typically a longer, thin rectangular shape
resulted in more frequent jams at lower densities (eg 10*3 rectangle). A square seemed to be the optimal shape for
free flow of traffic. Also, the size matter in the sense that size is somewhat dictated by shape. When the same ratios
of lenght and width were scaled, there was no substantial difference in traffic flow between densities.
